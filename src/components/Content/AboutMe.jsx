                            Josh began his professional career in theatre at Garland Summer Musicals. The Granville Arts
                            Center would become a bit of a summer home for him, trying out many hats along the way. Those
                            &quot;hats&quot; included actor, master carpenter, master electrician, and assistant stage manager. After
                            graduating from Tarleton State University with a fever for directing, Mr. Hensley set out to
                            find a theatre that would allow him to refine his skills. One such opportunity revealed itself
                            as Art Centre Theatre&apos;s production of Evil Dead the Musical. The production was fully directed 
                            and designed by Josh Hensley and was later nominated for Dallas Observer&apos;s &quot;Best of Dallas&quot; Reader&apos;s 
                            Choice for Best Musical. With his production of Murder Ballad, Hensley had convinced Artistic Director
                             Kyle McClaren that his style would work well with Garland Civic Theatre&apos;s vision and thus found a new 
                             home for many years. Directing shows such as Watson: The Last Great Tale of the Legendary Sherlock Holmes,
                              Dial M for Murder, The 39 Steps, and the US Premiere of The Widow.<hr/>

                            In 2016, Josh would try on a new hat: Teacher! He would instruct students at Naaman Forest High School in 
                            Technical Theatre for three years and in that time take their UIL OAP production of These Shining Lives to 
                            the Area competition, a first for Naaman Forest. In March 2020, at the beginning of the Pandemic, Josh would 
                            serve as Technical Manager for IMPRINT Theatreworks. His work could be seen in their many exciting productions 
                            such as, The Impact of the Gadget on Civilization and Pussy Riot! or Everything is P.R. Sadly, IMPRINT would 
                            close it&apos;s doors in 2022. Hensley is now the Technical Director for Theatre Frisco and a regular Lighting Designer
                             for Repertory Company Theatre.</p>
